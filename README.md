# Project: Basic-Express-Server

## Author: Hayden Cooper

## Problem Domain

- Deploy a simple Node.js server to EC2, using Elastic Beanstalk

        - Choose a server youâ€™ve built previously

            - Option 1: A simple API or Web Server
            - Option 2: A socket.io event Hub
            - The server should not require a database

- Check in your server to GitHub
  - Task 1:

    - Create a new environment, using Elastic Beanstalk from the AWS Control Panel (GUI)
        Manually deploy your application to this environment by uploading a .zip file
  - Task 2:

- Using the same server, create a new environment using Elastic Beanstalk from your terminal

- Manually deploy your application to this environment by using eb deploy
